# Virtueso - CPP Examples
This repo is for learning CPP, I will put my solutions to LeetCode questions

# Install requirements
To install required software, please follow (you may need to disable antivirus for these, your responsibility!)

```powershell
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

and

```powershell
lib/install_mingw.ps1
lib/install_cmake.ps1
lib/install_googletest.ps1
lib/install_raylib.ps1
```

all of these will be local installations under this folder `lib/external`. So you don't need to worry if it messes with your local installations. All the examples are for Windows and MinGW. Conversion to other OS will be your responsibilitiy, also.

# IDE
I used VScode as IDE and corresponding configs are under `.vscode` folder. Again: if you want to change IDE, it is your responsibility too.
